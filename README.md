# Lightsaber_2020
Personal project including 3D models, schematics and part links used to design a custom replica lightsaber.

I made this project during the pandemic when I needed a creative outlet but did not yet have the knowledge to design all electronics myself. Below are the links to the parts I purchased for the project.
